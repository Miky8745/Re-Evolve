# Evolve Game Engine

The **Evolve Game Engine** is a custom-built game engine designed to surpass my previous work, offering significant improvements and new capabilities. This engine serves as the foundation for a future 3D game project, drawing inspiration from survival games like *Rust*. However, my goal is to create a more technical and complex gameplay experience, focusing on deeper mechanics, systems, and player interactionsâ€”elements that align with the type of game I personally enjoy.

## Features

- Significant enhancements over the previous version
- Designed for 3D game development

## Future Goals

The long-term vision for the Evolve engine includes the development of a 3D game that combines survival, crafting, and exploration elements, similar to popular titles in the genre but with a stronger emphasis on intricate, technical gameplay. The aim is to offer a more challenging, detail-oriented experience that rewards strategic thinking and mastery.

**This is the final version, as development has moved to a private repository.**
